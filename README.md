## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or a compatible package manager like yarn or pnpm)
-   A [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) with Authentication enabled.
-   A [Google AI API Key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pet-guide
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env .env.local
```

Now, open `.env.local` and add your Firebase project configuration and Google AI API key.

```env
# Google AI API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# Firebase App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
```

**Important:** In your Firebase project's Authentication settings, make sure to add the local development domain (`localhost`) to the list of authorized domains.

### 4. Run the Development Server

You can now start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 5. Start the Genkit Development Server

For the AI features to work, you need to run the Genkit server in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

This will start the Genkit development UI, which you can use to inspect and debug your AI flows.
